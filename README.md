## My process
I have extensively used `CSS flexbox` for this design as I found it much easier than using grid for this design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

# some of the things I learned:
- At first I wasn't able to apply `border-radius` on the `main` tag but then I later learned that using `over-flow: hidden;` hid the overflowing edges and the `border-radius` got applied.
